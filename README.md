## Creating a New Notebook

- Click on the "New" button in the Jupyter dashboard and select "Python 3" (or any other available kernels) to create a new notebook.

## Working with Cells

- **Adding Cells**:
  - Press `B` to add a cell below the current cell.
  - Press `A` to add a cell above the current cell.
- **Changing Cell Types**:
  - Press `Y` to change a cell to a code cell.
  - Press `M` to change a cell to a Markdown cell (for documentation).
- **Deleting Cells**:
  - Press `D` twice (i.e., `D`, `D`) to delete a cell.

## Editing and Running Cells

- Double-click on a cell to enter edit mode.
- Press `Shift + Enter` to run the current cell and move to the next cell.
- Press `Ctrl + Enter` to run the current cell without moving to the next cell.
- Press `Alt + Enter` to run the current cell and insert a new cell below.

## Saving and Renaming Notebooks

- Click on the floppy disk icon (or use `Ctrl + S`) to save the notebook.
- To rename the notebook, click on the notebook name at the top, and a dialog will appear.

## Kernel Operations

- Restarting Kernel: Click on "Kernel" > "Restart" to restart the kernel.
- Interrupting Kernel: Click on "Kernel" > "Interrupt" to stop the execution of a cell.
- Resetting Kernel: Click on "Kernel" > "Restart & Clear Output" to restart the kernel and clear all cell outputs.

## Markdown Cells

- In Markdown cells, you can use standard Markdown syntax for formatting text.
- Press `Shift + Enter` to render the Markdown and exit edit mode.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Access the list of keyboard shortcuts by pressing `H` in command mode (press `Esc` to enter command mode).

## Cell Output

- Code cell outputs (e.g., printed values or plots) appear below the code cell.
- You can click on the left side of the output to hide or show it.

## Magic Commands

- Jupyter supports "magic commands" that start with `%` or `%%`. For example, `%matplotlib inline` for inline plotting.

## Help and Documentation

- Use `?` to access the documentation for a function or variable. For example, `len?`.
- Use `??` to access the source code of a function.

These are basic commands to help you get started with Jupyter Notebook. Explore additional features and extensions as needed.
